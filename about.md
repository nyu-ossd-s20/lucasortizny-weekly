I am an NYU Student studying Computer Science that plays a lot of video games.

### More Information

I also like to video edit in my free time. You can always catch me complaining on Twitter about anything that is trending or watching another episode of Kitchen Nightmares.
I love to organize events, which is why I am an eboard member for Tech at NYU. I am also doing a minor in Japanese so if you know any Japanese, I would love to practice with you!
