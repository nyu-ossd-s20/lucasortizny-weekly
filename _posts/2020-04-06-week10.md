title: Week 10 | Communication and Final Decision
---

The task for this week was to focus on the final decision for the project. 

This was a hard decision. But after spending more and more time looking at what our capabilities were for this project, we realized the first thing we could tackle was the first thing we do when we are contributing. 

One of the problems we noticed was that as we were trying to install the development environment, we realized that it was really difficult to figure out as new open source contributers (especially considering we are beginners). We needed to go into slack in order to find the installation page because it was not as easy to find on the repository. We have communicated with the communnity via the Slack channels so that we can verify this is not an intentional thing, as there are some open-sourced communities that want users to make a slack channel to authenticate themselves. Finally, we opened up the issue on the github repository and even an administrator on the project supported it. Overall it has been a very productive week~.
