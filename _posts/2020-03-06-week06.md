title: Week 6 | Further Project Evaluations
---

This week Vicky Steeves returned for a talk on open-sourced principles and licensing.

Licensing is such a huge component of open-sourced projects. It is important to determine how the licensing is going to affect the future reproducibility of their work. The emphasis for reproducibility is the purpose of open-sourced. Steeves talked about how there is a lot of resources available and even movmeents for trying to preserve the functionality of code. Open source depends on the management of workflow and process.  You need to think about where you want to deploy your code for compatibility. One thing to remember though is that the availability of code also needs to take into account the state of the politics surrounding the time period. Some of this can affect the long term access to software. 

Based on my project evaluation, I learned that there are issues with some projects. Some of them are too fast to keep up with, others are less responsive to pull requests or commits. There is also an issue when it comes to understandability of the code. It is very difficult to comprehend and I can see it being a potential issue for working on in the future. Another thing with this code is that this is sometimes in a language I am not proficient in. This to me is going to add an extra layer of work because it requires learning the language while also meeting the deadlines of the contributions on time.
