title: Week 8 | Continuation of the Selection
---

This week was a little chaotic. Because of this, I could not dedicate enough time to progress on the project in a physical sense.

However, I can at least say I thought about it. The debate between Tuxemon and OpenFoodFacts. I further consulted Jennifer and Alifa through text. We had to make a consideration on the python-based Tuxemon and the more HTML/Python-backed OpenFoodFacts. Overall, the decision is leaning towards OpenFoodFacts just because of the way the repository is shaped and the primary factor is the way we can easily contribute without being held back by the understanding of code. If we were to edit Tuxemon, we came to the realization that time needed to be spent to understand the core functionality and goal of the game before we would be able to add any type of content. For open food facts, there seems to be a simple basic structure and the rest of the data is added on to it. This makes it much faster to start right away and is an easy way to start solving issues. The goal that we decided on was to make an impact with our programs and one of the biggest obstacles is the limitation of knowledge of programming language. Not much can be said about this week but the thinking continues...
